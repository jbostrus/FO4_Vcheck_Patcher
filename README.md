# Vercheck_Patcher

This source will build a DXGI shim or F4SE/SKSE64 plugin that when used will patch the plugin header version check. The game EXE will check the version header and if it is too high it skips loading the plugin. This comes with a risk if you are using a game EXE that does not actually know how to handle the plugin odd things may happen.

This was originally developed because Bethesda changed the version header in the November 2019 Fallout 4 patch. This prevented using older game EXEs while waiting on other desired F4SE plugins to be updated.

## Build Instructions

Requires Visual Studio 2015 or newer. Community Edition is fine. The solution and project file may work on older versions but is untested.

This project has 3 build targets.
1) A DXGI shim which does not require F4SE or SKSE64. It still supports either Skyrim Special Edition or Fallout 4 based on build selection within the solution.
2) A F4SE plugin.
3) A SKSE64 plugin.

**NOTE:** When loading the solution you will receive an error from Visual Studio that one or more project files could not be opened. This happens if you do not have one or more of the F4SE or SKSE project files. Since the solution included tries to load both and this is atypical, this is normal. Verify that the projects you do have, are loaded.

### For building a DXGI shim:
1) Clone or extract this repository somewhere.
2) Load the solution.
3) Retarget for your SDK and build tools as necessary.
4) Choose one of the build targets (<Debug/Release>_<game>_Dxgi).
5) Build the solution.

### For building an SKSE64 or F4SE plugin

The setup requires special steps.

1) Extract or clone this repository into a work folder somewhere.
2) Download the clean f4se/skse64 source from their respective website [f4se's website](http://f4se.silverlock.org/) [skse64's website](http://skse.silverlock.org/)
3) Extract the f4se/skse64 sources into the work folder of the repository.

    * The work folder should now have 3 or 4 folders in it `common`, `skse64` and/or `f4se`, and `vercheck_patcher`.

4) Load the solution provided in the repository root folder.

    * You will need to add an include folder to the `f4se_common` and/or `skse64_common` projects.
    * For `f4se_common` add `$(SolutionDir)\f4se` to the list.
    * For `skse64_common` add `$(SolutionDir)\skse64` to the list.

5) Retarget for your SDK and build tools as necessary.
6) Coose one of the build targets for the game desired (<Debug/Release>_<game>_<xSE>).
7) Build the solution.

### A more manual method:

If you wish to do something different there are a few DEFINES that are important.

* `_SKYRIM64` - Specifies to use things relevant to Skryim Special Edition
* `_FALLOUT4` - Specified to use things relevant to Fallout 4
* `SKSE64` - Will use includes and other settings for SKSE64 plugin development
* `F4SE` - Will use includes and other settings for F4SE plugin development
* `_DXGI_SHIM` - Will enable and disable large chunks of code for use or not as a DXGI shim.
